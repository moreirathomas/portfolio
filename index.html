            Hi! I am a French student based in Paris who has recently gotten
            into web development. <br />I am a knowledge addict, always looking
            for new things to learn and master. Maybe a bit of a dreamer too.

              I am passionate about a lot of things, and amongst them are
              science, tech, philosophy and video games.

              I have a Bachelor's degree in Ecomonics and am a Mathematics
              enthusiast. I have been a competitive swimmer for over a decade
              and a coach for a swimming team.

              I am now diving in web development, programming and design as a
              student at HÉTIC. I want to be a part of truly interesting
              projects that offer someting meaningful for others.

              My first real school project. Done entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS &
              JavaScript. It is an short interactive experience in a web
              browser. Just try not to travel to close to the sun for too long
              (or just check the dev tools' console).

              I love video games, I love turn based games and I love Pokémon. So
              I had to try my hands at a small simulation of this. A nice
              opportunity to improve my skills with Node.js. I had also read
              about object composition in JavaScript a few days prior, so the
              all the logic is built around this principle.

              The Fermi Paradox and all the hypotheses around it are
              fascinating. While reading on the subject I though about making a
              small website that would present some of the current explanations.
              I was also learning React, so it was the perfect opportunity to
              better my skills.
